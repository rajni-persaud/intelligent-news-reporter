As production ramps up, its first stage offshore wells were projected to produce 750,000 barrels a day by 2025, tripling the size of Guyana\\'s economy, from US$3.4 billion to $13 billion. \\n Guyana also received its first U.S. secretary of state when Mike Pompeo visited on Sept. 17, reflecting both its rising international status as a major oil exporter and U.S. hopes that it will be an American partner in dealing with its troubled neighbor Venezuela. \\n But Guyana\\'s dreams of fabulous wealth this year have been dashed by COVID-19, which has delayed production and slashed oil demand. Compounding its coronavirus troubles, Guyana shows warning signs of the so-called \\\"resource curse,\\\" in which a country\\'s new oil wealth crowds out other productive economic sectors, breeds corruption and triggers political conflict. \\n If oil prices stay low, more countries could join the list of troubled petro-nations. My work on the link between the COVID-19 crisis, climate change risk, sovereign debt and oil suggests a looming crisis. \\n Burst hopes \\n Guyana, a former British colony with a population of 786,000, already struggles with political instability and ethnic tensions. \\n Earlier this year, in the first national election held since oil was discovered, accusations of corruption prompted a recount and an unclear presidential result.
